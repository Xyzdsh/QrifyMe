Project Overview
QrifyMe is a hybrid web application with two distinct backend systems:

Django Backend: Handles QR code creation and related logic.
Express/Mongo Backend: Manages user authentication (including JWT-based login/logout), product information, user details, and the administrative dashboard.
The frontend, built with React and Vite, communicates with both backends to provide a seamless user experience.

Features
QR Code Generation: Generate QR codes for URLs or text using Django.
User Management: Login, logout, and JWT authentication managed by Express and MongoDB.
Product & User Information: CRUD operations for product data and user profiles.
Administrative Dashboard: A comprehensive dashboard for managing data.
Responsive UI: Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
Tech Stack
Frontend: React + Vite
QR Code Backend: Django
User/Auth & Data Backend: Express with MongoDB
Languages: JavaScript (frontend & Express) & Python (Django)
Build Tools: npm, Vite
Architecture
Django Server:

Manages QR code creation and related logic.
Runs on a dedicated port (default: 8000) and exposes APIs for QR code generation.
Express/Mongo Server:

Handles authentication, including login/logout, JWT-based security, and CRUD operations for products and user information.
Connects to a MongoDB database for persistent data storage.
Runs on a separate port (commonly 3000 or any custom configuration).
Frontend (React + Vite):

Interacts with both backends.
Provides a unified user interface for QR code generation, user management, and dashboard operations.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js (v14+ recommended)
npm or yarn
Python (3.8+ recommended)
pip (Python package manager)
MongoDB (running instance or access to a hosted MongoDB)
Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/QrifyMe.git
cd QrifyMe
Setup the Frontend

bash
Copy
Edit
cd frontend
npm install
Setup the Django Backend

bash
Copy
Edit
cd ../backend_django
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux (or use venv\Scripts\activate on Windows)
pip install -r requirements.txt
Setup the Express/Mongo Backend

bash
Copy
Edit
cd ../backend_express
npm install
Running the Django Backend
Apply Migrations

bash
Copy
Edit
python manage.py migrate
Start the Django Server

bash
Copy
Edit
python manage.py runserver
The Django server should now be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

Running the Express/Mongo Backend
Ensure MongoDB is running (either locally or remotely, and update your connection string as needed).

Start the Express Server

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
The Express server should now be running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/ (or the port specified in your configuration).

Running the Frontend (React + Vite)
Start the Development Server

bash
Copy
Edit
cd ../frontend
npm run dev
The frontend should now be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5173/ or the port specified by Vite.

Configuration
Environment Variables:

Create .env files in both the Django and Express directories if needed.
For Django, configure settings such as database connection strings, secret keys, and allowed hosts.
For Express, configure your MongoDB connection string, JWT secrets, and other environment-specific variables.
CORS and API Endpoints:

Ensure that the necessary CORS configurations are in place so that the React frontend can communicate with both backends.
Update API endpoints in your frontend code to point to the correct backend URLs.
